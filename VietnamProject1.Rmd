The data set Vietnam in vcdExtra gives a 2x5x4 contingency table in frequency form reflecting a survey of student opinion on the Vietnam War at the University of North Carolina in May 1967. The table variables are sex, year in school, and response, which has categories (A) defeat North Vietnam by widespread bombing and land invasion; (B) Maintain the present policy; (C) De-escalate military activity, stop bombing and begin negotiations; and (D) Withdraw military forces immediately. How does the chosen response vary by sex and year?

#modeling Freq as a function of the three variables using the glm function. Family is set to poisson since we're modelling counts (independence model, assuming the three variables are independent of one another)

```
This seems to be a good model. There are highly significant coefficients and p-values near O. However, the residual deviance is not good since we have 423.83 on 31 df. This indicates a poor fit. 
```{r}
#calculate p-value for mod0
pchisq(deviance(mod0), df = df.residual(mod0), lower.tail = F)
```
The null of this test is that the expected frequencies satisfy the given loglinear model. Clearly they do not!
```{r}
#plot the model with only response and year
mod1 <- glm(Freq ~ response + year,
            data = Vietnam.tab, family = poisson)
summary(mod1)
```
This seems to be a similar model. There are highly significant coefficients and p-values near O. However, the residual deviance is 1772.9 on 39 df which indicates a poor fit. 

```{r}
#find the chi square for that model
pchisq(0.424, df = 31, lower.tail = F)
```

```{r}
#look at interactions
mod2 <- glm((Freq ~ response * year),
            data = Vietnam.tab, family = poisson)

```

```{r}
#verify that the homogenous assiciation model fits just as well as the saturated model by performing a likelihood ratio test 
anova(mod0, mod1, mod2)
```

#find the chi square for model 2
